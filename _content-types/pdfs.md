Only make a PDF if there is a strong user need.

PDFs are not accessible on mobile devices.

You must [make the content of the PDF  accessible](/accessibility-inclusivity/#pdf-accessibility):

- structure the PDF logically
- include 'PDF' and the file size in the link to the file
- provide contact details so the user can request the information in another format.
