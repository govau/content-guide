Your writing will be most effective if you understand who you’re writing for.

To understand your audience you should research:

- behaviour --- what the user is interested in or worried about, so your writing will catch their attention and answer their questions
- vocabulary --- so that you can use the same terms and phrases they will use to search for information

For multiple audiences, make your writing as easy to read as possible so it's accessible to everyone --- write for a [Year 5 reading level](#readability).
