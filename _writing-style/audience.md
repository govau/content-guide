Your writing will be most effective if you understand who youâ€™re writing for.

To understand your audience you should research:

- behaviour --- what the user is interested in or worried about, so your writing will catch their attention and answer their questions
- vocabulary --- so that you can use the same terms and phrases they will use to search for information

For multiple audiences, [make your writing as easy to read as possible](#readability) so it's accessible to everyone.
