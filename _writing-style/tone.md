The modern government tone is direct, calm and understated.

- Speak politely and use language that is positive but sensitive and respectful.
- Be aware who you are writing for.
- Be conscious of what the user needs to do.
- Tell the user what they need to know.

### Pronouns

Use first and second pronouns (I, we, us and you) to establish a connection with the user.

Avoid third person nouns (Australian Government Department of X) and pronouns (he, she, it and they).

Use 'they' and 'them' when talking about, rather than to someone or something.
