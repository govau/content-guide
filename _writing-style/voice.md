Use active voice (subject-verb-object).

Active voice gets straight to the point.

Avoid passive voice (object-verb-subject).

Passive voice usually makes it difficult to know who did what to whom and sends the reader backwards.

To write in active voice use first and second person (we, us) instead of third person (he, she, it and they).

### Contractions

Use contractions carefully to be more conversational.

Low-literacy users and people who speak [languages other than English](/accessibility-inclusivity/#languages-other-than-english) may find contractions difficult to understand.

Avoid less common colloquial contractions like you'd.

Always consider the context.

Don't use contractions where a user may misunderstand what they are being asked to do, for example on a form.

### -ings (gerunds)

Avoid using gerunds (-ings) where possible, for more concise language.
