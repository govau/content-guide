The terms 'First Australians' and 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' (note the plural) include distinct and diverse cultural groups. These terms do not represent a homogenous group.

Don't use:

- Aboriginals, Aborigine — these words are associated with colonisation and assimilation and are distressing to many people
- ATSI — never use the acronym ATSI as this is considered disrespectful
- Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians

### Use the correct language group name if possible

- The Ngunnawal woman spoke first.
- We wish to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land we are meeting on, the Ngunnawal people.

The [Australian Indigenous Languages Database](https://collection.aiatsis.gov.au/austlang/search){:rel="external"} from AIATSIS may help you identify the appropriate local language.

Use 'First Australians' or 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' (note the plural) if you are not sure of the local language group or are talking about multiple groups.

First Australian is not generally used in reference to an individual.

### Be careful using the word 'Indigenous'

While it is Australian Government practice to refer to Indigenous Australians, this is not preferred by many First Australians.

Indigenous is the common term when referring to a business entity or business function.

Indigenous should always be capitalised.
