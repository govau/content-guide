### The word ‘Indigenous’

While it is Australian Government practice to refer to Indigenous Australians, this is not preferred by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

Find an alternative to using Indigenous when you can, especially when referring to individuals.

It is preferable to use local language group names.

The [Australian Indigenous Languages Database](http://austlang.aiatsis.gov.au/main.php){:rel="external"} from AIATSIS may help you identify the appropriate local language.
