Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples represent a diverse range of cultures and are not 1 homogenous group.

Within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples/nations are many distinct cultural groups. English is a second, third or even fourth language for many First Australians.

Do not use:

- Aboriginals, Aborigine --- these words are associated with colonisation and assimilation and are distressing to many people
- ATSI --- never use the acronym ATSI as this is considered disrespectful and degrading
- Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Australians.

Instead use:

- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (note the plural)
- Aboriginal peoples (note the plural)
- Torres Strait Islander peoples (note the plural)
- Aboriginal man/woman/child
- Aboriginal Elder
- First Australians

### ‘Indigenous’

While it is Australian Government practice to refer to Indigenous Australians, this is not preferred by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Find an alternative when you can, especially when referring to individuals.

Indigenous is the common term when referring to a business entity or business function
