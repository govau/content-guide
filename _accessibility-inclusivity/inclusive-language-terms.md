### Avoid gendered pronouns

Rewrite the sentence to avoid using gender-specific singular pronouns (he/she, her/his, her/him).

### Speak to the person, not their difference

Speak to the person in plain English without jargon. Don't speak to their difference.

This avoids getting caught up in semantics and is respectful of:

- disability
- cultural differences
- differences in socioeconomic background
- differences in educational levels and systems
- generational differences
- gender roles
- perceptions of social and support concepts
- political impacts on life events
- pre and post effects of wars
- religious affiliations
- values or philosophical differences

### Transgender people

* Avoid the use of incorrect genders, or even gender pronouns if it is not specifically relevant.
* The general term to be applied in a document is 'transgender person' (not 'people identifying as transgender'. People may choose to self-identify as transgender, trans, or trans (identified gender)

Intersex is typically referred to as 'intersex', with no variation recommended - refer to the first resource.
