### Speak to the person, not their difference

Speak to the person in plain English without jargon. Don't speak to their difference.

This avoids getting caught up in semantics and is respectful of:

- disability
- cultural differences
- differences in socioeconomic background
- differences in educational levels and systems
- generational differences
- gender roles
- perceptions of social and support concepts
- political impacts on life events
- pre and post effects of wars
- religious affiliations
- values or philosophical differences.
