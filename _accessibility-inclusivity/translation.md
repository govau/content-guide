Find out if there is a user need to provide the content in other community languages.

This can be important if there are compliance requirements or health and safety issues.

### Identify the right languages

Research with users to find out which languages they need to read the information in.

Don’t just pick the top languages spoken at home, or another simple metric. These can be misleading about real user needs.

### Plain English is easier to translate

Write the content in Plain English first. This makes it easier to translate, and to read when translated.

### Translate the cultural context

Translating is not just about the literal words. It’s also about capturing the meaning of what you are communicating within the context of a culture.

### Use an accredited translator

It is best practice to use an [NAATI-accredited translator](https://www.naati.com.au/){:rel="external"}. Then ask  another accredited translator to check it.

### Make all formats accessible

Make sure the format of the translated content is accessible.

If there is a user need for a PDF of the translated content you must:
- make the plain English version available in HTML
- [make the content in PDFs accessible](/accessibility-inclusivity/#pdf-accessibility)
