Create [precise links and place them carefully]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-structure/#hyperlinks) where users need them.

Add [skip links](https://guides.service.gov.au/design-guide/patterns/navigation/#skip-links) to navigation and content. These are hidden visually by default but are keyboard accessible.

Make it easy for all users to know where they need to go.
