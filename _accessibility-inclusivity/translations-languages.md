Content written in plain English is easier to translate (and read). But translating is not just about the words, it’s also about capturing the meaning of what you are communicating within the context of a culture.

If your content needs to be translated, best practice is for this to be undertaken by [NAATI-accredited translators](https://www.naati.com.au/) and independently checked by another accredited translator.

See the Department of Social Services [Multicultural Language Services Guidelines for Australian Government Agencies](https://www.dss.gov.au/settlement-and-multicultural-affairs/programs-policy/multicultural-access-and-equity/multicultural-access-and-equity-resources).

Where a PDF version of content needs to be made available in more than one language, publish the PDFs with a plain English version in HTML.
