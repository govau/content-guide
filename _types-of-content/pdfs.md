Only publish a PDF if there is a strong user need. PDFs are not accessible to some users on mobile devices.

If you make a PDF, try to also publish in HTML. Publish the non-HTML format as a secondary source of the information.

Sometimes it may not be appropriate to publish in HTML, for example some types of specialist reports.  If you do not publish an HTML version, be sure to publish an HTML summary on a landing page — and provide contact details for users who are unable to access the PDF.

In all cases, you should follow guidance to make accessible PDFs. 

For example, you should:

- create a logical structure with chapters, headings, paragraphs and sections
- use bookmarks to help users locate content in long documents
- use PDF authoring tools that offer accessibility support, like Microsoft Office 10 or Adobe Acrobat's PDFMaker.

You can also use Adobe Acrobat Pro and other tools to check and improve accessibility of PDF files.
