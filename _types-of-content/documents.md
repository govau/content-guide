### Microsoft Word

Microsoft Word formats (.doc and .docx) don’t conform to [WCAG 2.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility-inclusivity/#wcag-for-content-authors).  Additionally they can be difficult to view on mobile devices.

Don’t publish Word documents on the web on their own. Provide the information on an HTML page as well. If this isn't possible, [create an accessible PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility-inclusivity/#pdf-accessibility) and publish both non-HTML formats from a landing page that summarises the document.

Make Word documents accessible to everyone even if you are emailing them internally. This includes people who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers.

When creating Word documents you should:

- use Word’s Outline View to help you manage structure and headings
- use Word’s Accessibility Checker to find issues and get tips
- use [alternative text]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility-inclusivity/#images-and-alt-text) with visuals and tables
- make sure that colour-coding is not the only way you convey information
- use enough contrast for text and background colours (Microsoft recommends the free app [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/){:rel="external"}
- use built-in headings and styles

### Google Docs

Google Docs is designed to work well with screen readers and assistive technologies.

### Rich Text Format (RTF)

You should avoid RTF as a publishing format. RTF can’t carry the same level of semantic information or accessibility that the .docx format can. Note though that Microsoft Word formats (.doc and .docx) don’t conform to [WCAG 2.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility-inclusivity/#wcag-for-content-authors) and can be difficult to view on mobile devices.

### Excel
Only publish an Excel document if there is a strong user need. They can be extremely difficult to view on mobile devices.

Sometimes it may not be appropriate to publish in HTML, for example when documents contain a large amount of data.

When publishing Excel documents, you should:

- include alternative text with all visuals and tables
- add meaningful hyperlink text and ScreenTips
- give sheet tabs unique names, and remove blank sheets
- use a simple table structure
- use the Accessibility Checker feature to find issues and get tips

Microsoft has guidance on [making Excel documents more accessible](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Make-your-Excel-spreadsheets-accessible-6cc05fc5-1314-48b5-8eb3-683e49b3e593){:rel="external"}. Also provide contact details for users who are unable to download the document.

### PowerPoint
Only publish a PowerPoint document if there is a strong user need.

Screen reading programs often interpret items on a PowerPoint slide in reverse order, which can confuse users with a vision or reading disability. However, PowerPoint has tools to help screen readers see slides in the way the author intended.

For example, use pre-existing slide templates. Don’t delete or rearrange the default slide elements as this could change the order of items on a screen reader.

For custom slides, you can set the reading order yourself in the Selection Pane.

You should also:

- use descriptive alternative text for pictures, charts, and other visual objects
- use accessible templates — PowerPoint has many
- use the program’s Grayscale feature to see how slides might look for someone who is colourblind
- make sure that colour-coding is not the only way you convey information
- make sure that animation is brief and does not distract from the main content
- use enough contrast for text and background colours

### EPUB
EPUB publications should include appropriate metadata.

[WCAG Level AA conformance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#top){:rel="external"} is recommended for EPUB publications.
