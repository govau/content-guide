Avoid the Latin abbreviations eg, ie, etc (et cetera) and nb. 

[Don't use italics for Latin]({{ site.baseurl }}/formatting/#italics).

### eg

Use ‘for example’ instead of ‘eg’. If space is limited, for example in a table, you can use &#8217;eg&#8217;. Only do this if your users can understand it (sometimes screen readers won’t read it correctly).

### ie

Avoid using ‘that is’ or ‘meaning’ as an alternative to ‘ie’. Rewrite and restructure your content instead.

### etc

Try to restructure the sentence so the user does not need to guess what may be missing. For example, 'We help people to improve their writing skills including grammar, spelling and research.

### nb

Do not use nb (nota bene, or ‘note well’).
