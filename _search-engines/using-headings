Headings are important for SEO. They tell both the user and search engines what a page is about. H1 is the main heading on a page and has the greatest SEO value. H2 and H3 subheadings have lower SEO value but should still follow the same pattern.

The DTA recommends no more than three levels of headings per page.

Write headings clearly and in plain English, so that search engines and users can understand the content on your page at a glance.

Use relevant [keywords in all headings]]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-structure/#headings-and-subheadings). For example, if youâ€™re writing about how to improve your content, a useful main heading could be: 10 ways to rewrite your website content.
