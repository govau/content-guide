Other metadata is used behind the scenes that helps search engines understand more about your content or what to do with it in search results. It is typically added into the code or fields of your Content Management System (CMS).

This information can also make it easier for your content to be related to similar content across government.

Some common examples of metadata are:

- index / noindex --- tells search engines whether to show your page in its results or not
- follow / nofollow --- tells search engines what to do with links on your pages

Metadata can also include specific things as such as location, times, contact information, file size, dates, author, image tags, social tags and more.

An example of metadata for an image might be:

- Title
- Author/Creator
- Subject
- Keywords
- Description
- Copyright
- Publisher
- Date
- File Type
- Format
