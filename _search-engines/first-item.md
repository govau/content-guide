How people search should influence the way you write.

What someone types into a search engine will give you insight into what they’re looking for. It’s important to understand what types of questions users are asking, and what keywords and phrases are popular. This can be done through user research and through your own website analytics.

There are 3 main types of search behaviour, depending on the audience:

- navigational --- searching for a specific webpage, for example ‘mygov login’
- informational --- searching for topical information, for example ‘can I get paid maternity leave?’
- transactional --- searching for a ‘how to’,for example ‘import wine into Australia’

Try writing to 1 or all 3 of these areas, especially in your headings:

- navigational --- for example ‘How to find your mygov login’
- informational --- for example ‘Get paid maternity leave’
- transactional --- for example ‘How to import wine into Australia’

If your information or service relates to a particular location or a particular age group, include these details — for example ‘student placements in northern NSW’.

### Voice search

Use of voice search is increasing. This is when a user speaks into their device to search for information. An example of this is Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana.

People write in a different way to how they speak, even when searching for the same information. Speech is often more conversational than the written word. Listening to the way people talk about your service and the words they use can be very helpful.

For example, a person may type 'hospitals near me'. If they were to speak it, they might say ‘where is the nearest hospital?’. When writing your content, it can be helpful to phrase some words in this way also.
