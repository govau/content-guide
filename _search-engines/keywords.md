Keywords are the common terms people use when searching for information. They should be user-focused, relevant and consistent.

Research with users to find out the keywords they will search with and click through to your page.

### Keyword research

The first step in SEO is to know what it is you’re optimising for. This means knowing the words people are searching with. These are the keywords you want your website pages to rank for. You can then use these keywords to write content that answers those queries.

  title = "selecting keywords"
  content= "
Your website helps users become Australia citizens.

You have researched with users who are keen to become Australian citizens. You have found they use the keyword 'citizenship' a lot.

You will want to include 'citizenship' a few times in the opening paragraphs of your content, in your meta title, meta description and URL."

### How to work out which keywords to use

You can find out which keywords to use through [research with users](https://guides.service.gov.au/user-research/){:rel="external"}.

Tools like [Google's AdWords Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/){:rel="external"} or [Keyword Tool](https://keywordtool.io/){:rel="external"} will also suggest keywords you can use. These tools also give you an estimated monthly search volume.

Another useful tool is the [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home){:rel="external"}. This tool shows what search queries Google is returning and how many clicks and impressions they get. A click is when a user clicks on your link in a search result. An impression is the amount of times a webpage has appeared in search results. 

These tools can help support your user research to find out which keywords people are searching for and what to write.

### Keyword categories

There are 3 main types of keyword categories. Try writing content to support at least 1 of these areas:

- navigational --- a search for a specific web page (for example, ‘mygov login’)
- informational --- a search for topical information (for example, ‘can I get paid maternity leave?’)
- transactional --- a search for a ‘how to’ (for example, ‘import wine into Australia’)

Some information may relate to a particular location or group of people. If so, make sure you include these details (for example, ‘student placements in northern NSW’).

### Writing keyword-based content

After you know what your keywords are, write your page content around those words. Be careful not to overuse keywords. This can have a negative impact your SEO efforts.

Include your keywords once or twice, if it makes sense, in the first paragraph of your content. Try to also include supporting content that contains related concepts and terms. This helps search engines understand the theme of your page. 

Take time to write content that is natural, easy to read and user-centred.

You are writing content to help users find Australian embassies in Europe.

Your user research has shown that when users are searching for an Australian embassy they are preparing to travel or they need help with an emergency situation.

So you also include useful content on travelling overseas and getting help for an emergency when in Europe.
