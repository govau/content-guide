You can help guide people to the content that is relevant to certain keywords through the process of on-page optimisation. 

### URLs

The URL path should include the keyword phrase you’re targeting the most. Place it close to the start of the URL. The URL should be as concise and clear, and make sense to users. While there is no strict guide on length, it’s good practice to keep your URL below 100 characters. 

For example:

https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/dta-playback-digital-service-standard

Use hyphens instead of spaces or underscores in the URL to separate the words. This helps search engines to understand each word clearly.

### Metadata

Metadata is often referred to as ‘tags’ that sit in the background of a webpage, within the code.

#### Meta title tag

Tells users and search engines what the topic of your page is about. In a search result, your title tag typically appears as the first line, acting as a headline of sorts. Your title tag should be unique for each page and be no more than 70 characters in length.

Words in the title are bolded if they appear in the search query. This is where understanding your keyword strategy becomes valuable. Knowing what users are searching for lets you make sure that those words appear as bolded in the results.

Keep your title short but relevant, using keywords. Titles that are too long will get cut off by search engines.

For example:

{% capture content %}
<figure>
  <img src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/seo-metatitle.png' alt='' />
  <figcaption>Caption: a meta title snippet for a Digital Transformation Agency page.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endcapture %}
{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "meta data in search result"
  content=content
%}

#### Meta description tag

Gives search engines a summary of what the page is about. Your description might be a couple of sentences, up to 160 characters in length. Google may use this description in your search result listing. This makes it a great opportunity to entice the user to click. 

For example: 

{% capture content %}
<figure>
  <img src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/seo-metadescription.png' alt='' />
  <figcaption>Caption: a meta description snippet for a Digital Transformation Agency page.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endcapture %}
{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "meta data in search result"
  content=content
%}

Google might also use a snippet of relevant text from the content on your page as an alternative description. 
The goal is to write compelling text that will lead people to click on your site. Using keywords in your description will help reassure users that this is what they're looking for. 

#### Heading tags

There are 6 heading tags.

For example:

{% capture content %}
<figure>
  <img src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/seo-headings.png' alt='' />
  <figcaption>Caption: html tags for the 6 heading tags.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endcapture %}
{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "meta data in search result"
  content=content
%}

Short content should use 2 subheading levels (h1 through h3). A heading tag (h) denotes a section heading and the numbers refer to their overall importance. h1 is the main heading and h3 would be the smallest and the least in priority of headings.

Heading tags help search engines understand the topic that you're writing about. The h1 tag is a great place to input your target keywords. There should only be one h1 per page.

For more on how to write headings, see [headings and subheadings]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-structure/#headings-and-subheadings).

### Page content

This refers to the page content itself. This needs to be optimised for users first and search engines second. Write in a way that targets users specific needs.

It makes sense that content about family tax benefits uses words such as child care, income, and payments etc. To optimise your content, write the way you would write for a human.

Search engines are looking for your main keywords and similar other words. Be careful of duplicate content. This is when large blocks of content are completely the same or very similar. Where there is duplicate content, search engines don’t know which content to link to.

### Internal links

Linking is the fundamental basis of the web. Search engines want to know you’re well connected with other pages and content. This is why linking out to other pages matters when it comes to search engine optimisation. 

For example:

{% capture content %}
<figure>
  <img src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/seo-links.png' alt='' />
  <figcaption>Caption: an internal link on a Digital Transformation Agency page.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endcapture %}
{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "meta data in search result"
  content=content
%}

Some tips for linking include:

- link to relevant content fairly early in the body copy
- link to relevant other pages of your site or other sites
- link with relevant anchor text (the clickable text in a hyperlink). For example, don’t use the word ‘here’ as your link text --- use your keywords and link from them.

### Images

When optimising images, use words that clearly describe the image to search engines. Examples of image optimisation include:

- insert ALT tags on all images, especially those that act as links to pages within the site
- use a main keyword in the ALT tag ensuring it’s descriptive of the image
- keep ALT tags short but accurate and don’t repeat words.
