### Page content

- Use clear introductions, conclusions and topics to organise content into paragraphs.
- Check for correct spelling and grammar and cite any sources properly using internal/external links.
- Use keywords naturally throughout your content.
- Use synonyms that Google uses to determine a page’s relevancy.

<### URL path

- The website page’s URL should include the main keywords for that page.
- Each word in the URL should be separated using dashes (-) and lower case.
- Length: try to keep it below 100 characters

### Meta title tags

- Describe what the page is about and use tags that are unique to each page. 
- Use your main keywords.
- Length: about 60-70 characters

### Meta description tag

- Use a description that accurately summarises the page content and is unique to each page. 
- Use keywords to create a compelling description that a searcher will want to click on.
- Length: 150-160 characters long

### Header tags

- The h1 heading tag gives users a quick overview of the content on the page. It should support the keyword theme from the metadata and use the main keywords. 
- Adding h2 and h3 heading tags helps structure your content more clearly. Try to include main keywords in at least one subheading and keyword variations in lower headings.

### Images

- Include descriptive captions and keywords within the image ALT tag and file names.

### Internal links

- Link to other pages on your website as appropriate. Try to include 2-3 links in every page. Make sure your links use keywords in the anchor text (the linked text itself), which is relevant to the page it’s linked to.
