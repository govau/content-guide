Check your content against this SEO checklist.

### Keywords

- Identify and use keywords naturally throughout your content.
- Make sure keywords are consistent with your title, description, headings, main body of content and metadata. For example, if ‘Wages for first-year apprentices’ is your heading, include this in the body of your text, your metadata and meta title for search. 

### Meta titles and descriptions

- Make sure that:

-- titles use up to 70 characters or less, including spaces
-- descriptions use up to 100 character per line, maximum of 3 lines.

- Check that titles and descriptions are automated in your CMS. 

- Make sure titles and descriptions are relevant to your topic.

- Be descriptive but clear.

- Be succinct, not wordy.

### Metadata (for your content management system)

- Check that all relevant metadata fields have been filled in.

### Headings

- Display headings on 1 line.

### Frontload your content with keywords

- Use H1 headings on your page first, followed by H2 and H3 headings.
- Reflect what your content is about. See [headings and subheadings]{{ site.baseurl }}/content-structure/#headings-and-subheadings/).

### Body of your content

- Mention your keywords at least 3 times, especially in the first 2 paragraphs.
- Identify the audience you are writing for --- for example single parents, apprentices, families.
- Use clear, plain English and check for [readability]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing-style/#readability/).
