The best search results are gained when it’s easy for users to find content and understand it clearly. 

When content is simple, clear and useful, it is perceived to be more trustworthy.

When users trust your information, this helps to establish ‘topic authority’, a strong ranking factor for search engines. 

Building strong SEO through topic authority includes things like:

- answering a range of relevant questions in your content
- using simple clear language
- having a strong backlink strategy (links coming in from other reputable organisations, agencies and businesses)
- volume of people clicking through to your content
