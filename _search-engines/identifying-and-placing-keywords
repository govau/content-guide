Keywords are the standout words or phrases that people scan for when reading content. Some ways to identify keywords are through user research, analytics, Google’s Keyword Planner etc.  

For example, ‘minimum wage for apprentices’ may be a keyword phrase you might use in your content when writing on this topic. Another example could be keywords such as ‘family’, ‘payments’, ‘single parents’, ‘benefits’ when writing on the topic of family tax benefits.

Keywords alone don’t improve search rankings, but they encourage ‘click-throughs’ by users. Click-throughs are the volume of visitors or traffic who follow a link to your page. That is, the more people who click through to your page, the more a search engine is likely to rank it.

### Where to place keywords

Try and place your keywords mostly at the beginning of your content. This is called frontloading. 

Use keywords in:

- all headings
- body content --- particularly the first 2 paragraphs, as people tend to ‘drop out’ after this if they’re not engaged with the content from the beginning 
- meta titles and descriptions 

Make a list of the standout words and phrases you may use. Avoid ‘keyword stuffing’. This is when there are too many of the same keywords used on a page. Your content should read clearly and naturally without being repetitive.

Ensure that your content has:

- a clear hierarchy, with the most important information coming first. See [content structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-structure/).
- clear, accurate information
- meaningful and unique meta titles and descriptions
