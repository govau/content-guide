### SEO and analytics

Tools such as Google Analytics are used to understand things like:

- what keywords and phrases users are searching for
- how users are discovering content related to your keywords
- what pages users are landing on
- how long users spend on your site
- how many return visitors you get
- what your overall volume of traffic is and where it’s coming from
- how many first time visits you get
- bounce rates
- most popular pages/ least popular pages
- referring sites.

Understanding this data can help you get clearer on what content you need to be writing. This will help improve your SEO efforts and get the best results for both your users and your agency.
