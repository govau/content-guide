The meta title is the main linked title that users see and click on in search results.

The meta description is the short description or call to action users see under the title in search results.

This meta information is often automated in your content management system (CMS). However it is best to check how your CMS has been built and set up beforehand.

Meta titles and meta descriptions are an important ranking factor for search engines. They are the actual words that are seen by users in search results.

In the following example:

- meta title: 'Latest blog posts &#124; Digital Transformation Agency'
- meta description: 'Read the latest blog posts from the Digital Transformation Agency.'

{% capture content %}
<figure>
  <img src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/seo-sample.png' alt='' />
  <figcaption>Caption: a search snippet for a Digital Transformation Agency page.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endcapture %}
{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "meta data in search result"
  content=content
%}

Your meta title should be very clear to the user as to what that page is about.

Your meta description needs to be interesting as well as clear and relevant. Use an active voice with the right keywords to encourage people to click through to your content.

Write to the set word and character lengths.

For example:

- Google title tags are limited to 70 characters (including spaces)
- Meta descriptions are 100 characters per line (including spaces) up to 3 lines
