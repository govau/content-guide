Use digits instead of words for most numbers. This makes numbers easier to read on a screen.

Use words for:
- common expressions where digits would look strange --- for example, 'one or two of them'
- ordinals (first, second) but not [dates and date periods](#dates) (19th century)

Add a comma between the third and fourth digit from the right, for numbers 10,000 and above.

Use the word million instead of digits.
