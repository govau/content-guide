Acronyms are terms that are comprised of initial letters that can be pronounced as a word. 

* Qantas
* Anzac 
* TAFE

Initialisms are terms comprised of initial letters that are pronounced individually. 

* ABC
* GST
* NDIS

Initialisms are commonly misunderstood to be acronyms.

### Writing acronyms and initialisms

Only use an acronym or initialism when:

* you need to refer to a term more than once
* it will make content easier to understand

When writing an acronym or initialism:

* write the term in full the first time you use it
* follow this with the acronym or initialism in parentheses
* use only the acronym or initialism in subsequent mentions

But you don't need to write the full term if it is well known to an Australian audience. 

* NSW
* ABC

If you are writing for an international audience, use the general rule for writing the term in full the first time it is used.

Don’t use full stops or spaces in acronyms or initialisms.

* ATM --- not A.T.M. or A T M

When using an acronym or initialism for the name of an organisation, check with that organisation (for example, using its website or annual report) to ensure you are using it correctly.

### Acronyms that are accepted as words

Some acronyms are words in general usage. In these cases, you don’t need to write the full term.

Write these acronyms with an initial capital letter when they are proper names of things.

* Anzac
* Qantas

Write these acronyms in lower case when they are commonly accepted words.

* scuba
* radar
* laser

### Function words in acronyms and initialisms

Generally, write acronyms and initialisms without the initial letters for function words such as 'of', 'and' or 'the'.

* ABS
* CSIRO 
* NGA

Sometimes initial letters for minor words are used when they make acronyms or initialisms easier to say or understand. In most cases, write these as capital letters. 

* COAG
* CHOGM
* NAPLAN
