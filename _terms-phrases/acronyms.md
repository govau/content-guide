You don't need to spell out acronyms that are well known to an Australian audience. For example, NSW or ABC.

If you are writing for an international audience spell it out once and then use the acronym.

Most acronyms for companies or organisations are upper case, with the exception of Anzac.

Don’t use full stops in acronyms.
